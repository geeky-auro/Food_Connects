                            Moving to Jakarta several years ago made Novi Yanti think about starting her own business and chose to develop a cooking activity that would not only become a routine but also provide additional income. According to the owner of Pempek Dos Sriwijaya, culinary delights are always fun to explore, create, and of course taste. Therefore, Novi decided to focus on the traditional food business of Palembang, which is her birthplace, namely pempek.                        </p>

                                    All Indonesians are familiar with pempek, this food from Sumatra, especially Palembang, has fans everywhere. Pempek is generally made from fish and flour. However, this woman who took a cooking course in one of the areas in the capital city combines fish and flour with other complementary ingredients such as ebi, young papaya (kates), and eggs as a filling. All Pempek Dos Sriwijaya products are handmade in their favorite kitchen. Making dough is Novi's favorite process, because making dough requires precision in mixing the ingredients so that the unique taste is maintained. Novi also always pays attention to the freshness of every ingredient used to produce pempek in order to produce a product that can cure the longing of Palembang pempek lovers.                                </p>

                            By daring to innovate, maintaining unique flavors, accepting suggestions and criticism from customers, and following developments in the culinary world, Novi hopes to continue to revive and advance the Pempek Dos Sriwijaya product to remain a favorite product for friends at various events, times and places.                        </p>
